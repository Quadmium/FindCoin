Findcoin
========
-----------------------------------------------------------------
We are all fed up with scammers. We want to see their faces, and some of them behind bars. Let's put a bounty dedicated to those who are willing to conduct an investigation.

Findcoin was created with a sole purpose to raise such a bounty as a reward for the deanonymization of certain "developers". We don't care if this coin gains zero value or even hits an exchange at all, but instead our intention are to create a symbol, a banner for everyone in the community that want those people to be found and brought to legally applicable justice.

This coin is dedicated to all who fell victim to the countless scams and is also a place to conduct research about developers who used our trust to earn money they never deserved. We realize that we cannot do this on our own but we hope that community unites here and produces some good results.

What we propose is to create crypto-currency with only one purpose - fund bounties for the info about scam devs. No matter how much volume this coin gets, it will always remain as a symbolic reward for the effors of those who care. We aren't telling you to do something bad to these people, no. However we deserve the right to find them and know their real identities and gather proof and evidence and perhaps one day some of them will regret what they did to us.

To fulfill our idea we created a coin and faucet that will giveaway *most?* of the money supply to anyone willing to accept it. Everyone can get coins for free and will be able to donate them as a bounty for the info about their most hated developers. Someone smart enough to find a developer's credentials will receive that bounty after the provision of certain proofs - then all of the information will be published. When and if someone becomes deanonymized, everyone will know how they can support this effort, and invest in something that ensures a safe environment for the rest of us.

Why don't you guys just gather BTC's?
We've been here long enough. We know how most fundraisers turn out. You pay someone BTCs for a good cause and next day watch as the publish pictures of them self in a bathrobe somewhere in the hotel spending your hard earned money on the vodka and chicks. We could promise you anything but we do not expect someone to believe us and you are no exception. Instead, let this coin be in your wallets and outside of the market for the time being. There will be no mining costs and no efforts required to acquire these coins. Let it stay with you until some scammer, or at least someone is found. At that very moment you will know which coin you should invest in to reward those who ensured your security and exposed frauds. Let's come up with a blacklist of scam-coins, let's gather what we have in one place and let's pursue those things and find them.

We invite everyone to participate in this initiative, update research and explore every possible bit of information about these scam-coins and their developers.
Submit coin names with links on scam threads and we will keep track of it. We will also try to sort out all of information about the progress. Let's do it together. Every bit counts, tell us how many coins scammed, what you know about the developer, post links and post evidence. Be active and eventually we will find these horrible people.
